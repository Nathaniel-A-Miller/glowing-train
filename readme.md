# PISA 2012 Data:
## Qualitative Reading Factors in Chinese and American Educational Culture
### by Nathaniel A. Miller


## Dataset

The dataset consists of a survey by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) of about 510,000 15-16-year olds from OECD countries. They survey consists of evaluations of mathematical, scientific, and reading ability, and a questionnaire about various social, educational, and cultural beliefs and practices.


## Summary of Findings

The largest volume of participation in PISA is from Mexico. Globally, the plurality of students surveyed
possess 26-100 books. Reading scores are normally distributed, but Chinese overperform on math, while Americans
overperform slightly on reading. I looked at two sets of measures to see what corresponded to higher reading
performance. I found that there is a clear correlation both between the number of books students report having at home and parents' highest education level. Since these are probably highly multicollinear variables, that both are correlated to student reading performance is not surprising. Globally, reading performance (looking at the median and interquaretile range) increases depending on how liked students feel (except those who responded "strongly agree"), while there is a significant decrease in performance depending on how strongly students "feel like an outsider." While in the US students who felt others disliked them performed much more poorly on reading evaluations, there is very little discnible variation amongst the four responses for Chinese students. Among American students, the more strongly the students feel like outsiders, the lower their reading performance. There is a similar correlation among Chinese students, but it is not as stark. Although in both countries reading performance increases with parents' educational level and number of books at home, in terms of absolute performance, parents' educational level does not constrain Chinese students, or rather, it is not a sufficient explanatory variable for US students' lower performance; we see, for example, that students' with parents who have reached ISCED 3 (high school, A-levels) have a visibly superior median and interquartile range for their reading scores than American students with BAs. Chinese students also perform better with fewer books at home.


## Key Insights for Presentation

How do measures of social acceptance correspond to different performance levels in China and the US? This is the most interesting result. While in the US students who felt others disliked them performed much more poorly on reading evaluations, there is very little discernible variation amongst the four responses for Chinese students. Among American students, the more strongly the students feel like outsiders, the lower their reading performance. There is a similar correlation among Chinese students, but it is not as stark. Here it does seem as if we finally have a measure of socio-cultural values affecting education. We can speculate that while it is accepted in the US that introversion, social exclusion, or low self-esteem may facilitate poorer reading performance, these characteristics are either less tolerated among Chinese children or their affect on their reading performance is nullified or unacceptable in some way.

In terms of design I removed explorations unrelated to the main thread about factors correlating to better reading performance that could be compared between the US and China. I also attempted to improve and coordinate the color of my plots better
